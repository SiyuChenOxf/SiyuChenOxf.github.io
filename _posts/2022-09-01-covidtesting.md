Pregnant patients have increased morbidity and mortality in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The exposure of pregnant patients in New York City to SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood due to early lack of access to testing and the presence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections. Before the availability of vaccinations, preventative (shielding) measures, including but not limited to wearing a mask and quarantining at home to limit contact, were recommended for pregnant patients. Using universal testing data from 2196 patients who gave birth from April through December 2020 from one institution in New York City, and in comparison, with infection data of the general population in New York City, we estimated the exposure and real-world effectiveness of shielding in pregnant patients. Our Bayesian model shows that patients already pregnant at the onset of the pandemic had a 50% decrease in exposure compared to those who became pregnant after the onset of the pandemic and to the general population.

Positive results from RT-PCR testing and serology testing can both be used to identify infected or recently infected individuals. While an infected individual turns RT-PCR positive and then RT-PCR negative within the span of days to a week, a positive serology test result can serve as a maintained marker of infection that last for months. By capturing this dynamic effect of antibody waning in our models, we found that SARS-CoV-2 exposure estimates were much higher than the seroprevalence estimates for our sample of pregnant patients and the general public in New York City. These results confirm that previous studies looking at RT-PCR positive testing rates or seroprevalence alone will substantially underestimate population-level and subgroup exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

We found that patients who gave birth between April and August of 2020 had lower levels of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 compared to the general population. In fact, in the first months of the pandemic (April and May 2020), the exposure levels of pregnant patients were half of the exposure levels of the general population in New York City, and half of the exposure levels in pregnant patients who gave birth by the end of 2020. To understand the possible variables that contribute to this lower exposure level in pregnant patients who gave birth early in 2020, we must take into account the distinctions between the experience of pregnant patients who gave birth in early 2020 vs. late 2020. Patients that gave birth before August 2020—before the level of exposure in pregnant patients became comparable to that of non-pregnant patients—were all at least in their mid to late first trimester by the time that the pandemic hit New York City. This means that most of these patients had a high probability of knowing about their pregnancy at the onset of the pandemic, and it is possible that this knowledge of pregnancy led to behavior changes that made them more cautious than the general population. In contrast, the patients giving birth towards the end of 2020 were not pregnant and/or did not know of their pregnancy before the onset of the pandemic and may not have behaved differently than the general population; in other words, they could be considered part of general population in early 2020. During the early part of the pandemic, the population only had access to shielding measures and other non-pharmaceutical measures for prevention of disease exposures (since vaccinations only became available for the general population in early 2021). Thus, the reduction of exposure in pregnant patients by about half early in the pandemic may be attributed to effectiveness of shielding measures (Table S4). Our current data do not address whether pregnant patients (especially those that gave birth early in the pandemic) were more stringent than the general population in following recommendations for behavioral changes and other non-pharmaceutical interventions, or whether they had additional means of improving the efficacy of shielding in preventing exposure. It is less likely that biologic differences from the state of being pregnant contributed to exposure differences as the pregnant patients that gave birth later in 2020 had similar exposures to the general population.

Such a high-level reduction of exposure might have been associated with a reduction in infection and especially a reduction of severe COVID-19 illness and, consequently, in mortality in pregnant patients. A large-scale retrospective analysis from a database that covers about 20% of the American population and includes 406 446 patients hospitalized for childbirth (6380 (1.6%) of whom had COVID-19) compared outcomes for pregnant patients with and without COVID-19 from April–November 2020 [30]. It concluded that in-hospital maternal death was rare, but rates were significantly higher for patients with COVID-19 (141/100,000 patients, 95% CI 65–268) than for patients without COVID-19 (5/100,000 patients, 95% CI 3.1–7.7). The estimate of maternal death rate is consistent with the study from the UK AAP SONPM registry, where a perinatal maternal mortality rate of 167/100,000 (for patients who have COVID-19 around the time of birth) was estimated [9,31]. Further calculation shows that the 40% to 50% reduction on exposure to SARS-CoV-2 estimated by our study might have led to the prevention of 70 (95% CI 26–134) per 100,000 maternal deaths in New York City.

After the period included in our study, additional SARS-CoV-2 preventative measures in the form of vaccinations were introduced in 2021 although strict quarantine regulations were also lifted from the city by then. Pregnant patients were not included in studies testing the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Studies conducted since the start of vaccination distribution including those looking at the real-word implementation of vaccination have confirmed the safety and effectiveness of vaccines specifically for pregnant patients, their placentas, and their neonates [13,32,33,34,35]. In fact, one study showed that vaccinated pregnant patients had almost 50:1 lower odds of severe COVID-19 infection [13]. Our data highlights the utility of shielding measures, and argues for an integrated intervention as suggested by CDC and NHS guidelines, which includes a combination of vaccination and shielding to reduce the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 during pregnancy.
