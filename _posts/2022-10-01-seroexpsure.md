Accurate knowledge of prior population exposure has critical ramifications for preparedness plans for future SARS-CoV-2 epidemic waves and vaccine prioritization strategies. Serological studies can be used to estimate levels of past exposure and thus position populations in their epidemic timeline. To circumvent biases introduced by the decay in antibody titers over time, methods for estimating population exposure should account for seroreversion, to reflect that changes in seroprevalence measures over time are the net effect of increases due to recent transmission and decreases due to antibody waning. Here, we present a new method that combines multiple datasets (serology, mortality, and virus positivity ratios) to estimate seroreversion time and infection fatality ratios (IFR) and simultaneously infer population exposure levels. The results indicate that the average time to seroreversion is around six months, IFR is 0.54% to 1.3%, and true exposure may be more than double the current seroprevalence levels reported for several regions of England.

We propose a new method to forecast the total exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from seroprevalence data that accounts for seroreversion and uses daily mortality and test positivity ratio data to aid inference. The associated estimate of time to seroreversion of 176 days (95% CrI: 159â€“197 days) lies within realistic limits derived from independent sources. The total exposure in regions of England estimated using this method is more than double the latest seroprevalence measurements. Implications for the impact of vaccination and other future interventions depend on the, as yet uncharacterized, relationships between exposure to the virus, seroprevalence, and population immunity. To assess vaccination population impact, one can consider the population at risk to be those individuals who are seronegative, those with no past exposure (confirmed or predicted), or those with no T-cell reactivity. Here, we offer an extra dimension to the evidence base for immediate decision-making, as well as anticipating future information from the immunological research community about the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 exposure and immunity.
