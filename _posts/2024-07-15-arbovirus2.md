Arthripod-born viruses have expanded into new regions in Europe, yet data indicate gaps in disease notifications and risk of further spread. We report on prevalence, clinical management, and outcomes of endemic arbovirus infections in Southeast Europe.

A prospective observational study including adults hospitalised with an arbovirus-compatible disease syndrome of onset within 21 days, set in 21 hospitals in seven countries in Southeast Europe over four arbovirus seasons (1 May 2016-31 October 2019). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with reference laboratory confirmed or probable West Nile Virus (WNV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV), and Toscana virus (TOSV) infection. Secondary outcomes were the proportions of patients treated with antivirals, antibiotics, and/or corticosteroids; the proportion of patients requiring intensive care; hospital length of stay; and health outcomes at discharge.

Of 2896 adults screened for eligibility, 913 (median age: 43 [IQR: 30-60] years, 60.2% (550/913) male), 58.1% (530/913) presented with suspected meningitis and/or encephalitis, 34.8% (318/913) with fever plus myalgia/arthralgia. 89.8% (802/913) reported no international travel within 21 days pre-symptom onset. 79.6% (727/913) were administered antibiotics, 41.5% (379/913) corticosteroids, 24.3% (222/913) antivirals. Median hospital length of stay was 9 days (IQR: 6-14), 12.4% (113/913) required intensive care. Of those with a reference laboratory sample, 13.0% (110/847) were diagnosed with an arbovirus infection: CCHFV 0.1% (1/847), TBEV 1.9% (16/847), TOSV 5.2% (44/847), WNV 6.3% (53/847), with a case fatality rate of 0.9% (1/110). Of the reference laboratory-diagnosed arbovirus infections,44.5% (49/110) were diagnosed with arbovirus infections locally.  

Our data highlight the need to strengthen arbovirus surveillance systems for the early detection of new and (re-)emerging outbreaks, including investments to increase awareness of arbovirus
infections among clinicians, improve access to specialist diagnostics, as well as develop effective and accessible vaccines and treatments to protect populations and health systems.
