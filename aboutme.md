I am an infectious disease ecologist and modeller, working at the interface of theoretical models and empirical data, with a focus on global health and policymaking. During my DPhil at Oxford University, I studied population immunity and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK, US, low-and middle-income countries and in specific settings, including healthcare, care homes and school. My research encompassed a broad spectrum of disease ecology, including outbreak preparedness, health economics, health equality and population behavioral dynamics. My work had a strong translational component; I worked with international public health consortia with results and recommendations delivered to the Ministry of Health of Afghanistan and WHO EMRO. I led a COVID-19 testing evaluation program in England partnering with the UK Health Security Agency and animated a multi-center European study of arboviruses.   

- I rock a great mustache

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
