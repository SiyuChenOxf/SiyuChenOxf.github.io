I am an infectious disease ecologist and modeller, working at the interface of theoretical models and empirical data, with a focus on global health and policymaking. 

During my DPhil at Oxford University, I studied population immunity and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and its applicaiton in the UK, US, low-and middle-income countries and in specific settings, including healthcare, care homes and school. 

My research encompassed a broad spectrum of disease ecology, including outbreak preparedness, health economics, health equality and population behavioral dynamics. 

My work had a strong translational component; I worked with international public health consortia, organisations and ministry of health. I led a COVID-19 testing evaluation program in England partnering with the UK Health Security Agency and animated a multi-center European study of arboviruses.
